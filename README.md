## Top 3 remote work tips

### 1. Normal meeting rules apply.

* [Only a few short ones per day.](https://www.calendar.com/blog/perfect-amount-of-meetings-per-day-backed-by-science/)
* [If you think there might be a problem with a meeting, take it seriously.](https://seths.blog/2009/03/getting-serious-about-your-meeting-problem/)

### 2. Zoom when you can. [Loom](https://www.loom.com) when you can‚Äôt.

* In their words, ‚ÄúRecord video messages of your screen and cam. Faster than typing an email or meeting live.‚Äù
* With a free account, you get a hundred 5-minute videos.
* They are easy to share and they send you an email when someone watches it.

[Here‚Äôs an example](https://www.loom.com/share/31e46b9697a44a0aab1b99347f2766d9) I sent before a product team meeting.

### 3. Wait 7 seconds.

Compared to being in the same physical room, it‚Äôs more difficult to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the timing of when to start speaking, stop listening, or switch topics. Waiting 7 seconds is a good rule of thumb to leave space for people to react after asking a question or before moving on from the topic at hand.
