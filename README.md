# Design at Chargeback

This is what we are working on at Chargeback. Some things are public and some require a password.

So many ideas for this thing. Just going to start unloading content here and will refactor later.

## Decision workshop

Hadley and Matt are collaborating on the structure for this. We believe we should be doing more structured workshops in the long-term, and we believe training our peers on how to run more stuctured workshops is a great way to foster that in the short-term. The next thing to do is find out.

We are running an initial test workshop in January based on the [lightning decision jam](https://youtu.be/xNpVaNIUS4U). Here’s a rough outline of the exercises we plan to use:

1. Map
    1. Pile of problems · 7m
    2. Present · max 30s per item
    3. Silent vote
2. Sketch
    1. Written solutions or crazy 8s · 7–8m
    3. Moderator prioritizes list of solutions
3. Decide
    1. Higher or lower → effort vs. impact
    2. How do we actually do this?
4. Prototype
    1. Stitch together together

Another idea we had was to take any of these individual exercises and do practice runs for each to see how people do. Either way, we will try something new, learn and repeat. “The Toolbox.”

Here are some other great references about the “shortcut to learning process” we’ll leverage based on the outcome(s) of our first workshop(s):

## Beta program

Codenamed “The Volume.” We want you! ([my finger points](https://youtu.be/KMX-s7H5N_g))

Need to work out the details with Jeremy.

## Baseline bounty

Analytic insights might be a necessary prerequsite to investing back into core experiences in Chargeback. How can we justify workflow disruption and change management without showing the stakeholders our users report to of the value of our work?

Example: show comparison metric for average cases worked per person per hour BEFORE we modify any of the workspaces

## Browser extension

The first set of features might be limited in scope to internal users. Regardless, the baseline bounty (see above) is a relevant prerequsite to [making people care](https://gfda.co/index.php#/advice/34) about this.

## Figma all day

Feel free to leave comments on [our first prototype](#) we tested with customers. (link requires password)

## Brand & UI kit

Marketing just needed a keystone legacy screen for now. Plenty to do later.
